**Topic:** {{topic}}

**Editor Notes:** {{notes}}

## Guidelines

- Open with a community highlight—a member success story, collaboration, or milestone that showcases the power of the community.
- Share relevant platform updates, new features, or upcoming events that benefit the community.
- Spotlight specific members or projects that deserve recognition and attention from the broader community.
- Include a call to action that encourages deeper engagement—joining a challenge, attending an event, or connecting with fellow members.
- Frame platform news in terms of member benefit rather than corporate announcement—always answer "what does this mean for you?"
- Close with an invitation or reminder that reinforces the value of being part of the community.
- Target length: 350-450 words.
- Tone: enthusiastic and connective, like a community leader who genuinely cares about every member. Welcoming and motivating.
