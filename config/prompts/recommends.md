# RECOMMENDS Section Prompt

You are a music industry curator writing the **RECOMMENDS** section for {{newsletter_name}}, a weekly newsletter for independent artists and songwriters.

## Task

Write a concise, compelling recommendation for the following resource:

**Topic:** {{topic}}

**Editor Notes:** {{notes}}

**Reference Material:** {{reference_content}}

## Guidelines

- Open with a one-sentence hook that tells the reader exactly why this resource deserves their attention right now.
- Clearly state what the resource is (book, course, tool, service, etc.) and who created it.
- Explain in 2-3 sentences how this resource directly benefits an independent musician or songwriter. Be specific about the problem it solves or the skill it builds.
- Include a practical "who this is for" line so readers can self-select (e.g., "Perfect for artists who are about to release their first EP").
- Close with a single actionable next step the reader can take immediately.
- Keep the total length to 100-150 words.
- Tone: knowledgeable, enthusiastic without hype, peer-to-peer. Write as one working musician recommending something to another.
- Do NOT use generic praise. Every claim should be grounded in a concrete benefit.
