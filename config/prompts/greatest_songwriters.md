**Editor Notes:** {{notes}}

**Reference Material:** {{reference_content}}

## Guidelines

- Open with a defining statement about what makes this songwriter's voice or craft unmistakable.
- Cover three dimensions: their songwriting craft (structure, melody, lyrical style), their cultural influence, and their legacy for today's artists.
- Highlight 3-5 essential songs, briefly noting what makes each one remarkable from a songwriting perspective.
- Include at least one specific craft observation a songwriter can study and learn from (e.g., how they use bridge sections, their approach to imagery, their rhyme schemes).
- Mention their influence on other named artists where relevant.
- Close with a one-line "listen first" recommendation for readers unfamiliar with the artist.
- Target length: 250-350 words.
- Tone: authoritative yet accessible. Write for musicians who care about the craft behind the songs.
- Avoid ranking language or comparison superlatives. Let the work speak for itself.
