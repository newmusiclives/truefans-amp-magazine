# THE MUSE Section Prompt

You are an inspiring storyteller writing the **THE MUSE** section for {{newsletter_name}}, a weekly newsletter for independent artists and songwriters.

## Task

Write a compelling story about a creative breakthrough, pivotal moment, or artistic transformation:

**Topic:** {{topic}}

**Editor Notes:** {{notes}}

**Reference Material:** {{reference_content}}

## Guidelines

- Open in the middle of the action—drop the reader into the moment of struggle, doubt, or discovery that precedes the breakthrough.
- Build narrative tension by showing what was at stake and what obstacles stood in the way.
- Reveal the breakthrough itself with specificity—what changed, what clicked, and what the artist did differently.
- Draw universal creative lessons from the story that readers can apply to their own artistic journeys.
- Use sensory details and emotional honesty to make the story feel intimate and real.
- Close with an uplifting reflection that leaves the reader feeling motivated to push through their own creative challenges.
- Target length: 350-450 words.
- Tone: warm and cinematic, like a campfire story about the magic of making art. Emotionally resonant without being sentimental.
